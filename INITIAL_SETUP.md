Create a video chat application which uses peerjs to share video feeds.

Use a custom peer server hosted locally that can be run with "npm run peer".

Authentication is not needed.

The video feeds should connect with each other on page load.

Assume all users to join a single room that everyone joins automatically.

Use shadcn components where useful.
